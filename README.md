# UIUC Mechanical Engineering MEng Project Code
Contains the MATLAB code that I developed during my Mechanical Engineerig ME research at UIUC.

# Short Description
The objective of the project was to model the frontal polymerization process.  It was being done in collaboration with a group in the chemistry department working on experiments.  The setup is a microchannel of around 1 mm diameter containing a monomer.  The microchannel is surrounded by an inert matrix for insulation.  The polymerization progresses in the microchannel as a self sustaining thermal front upon ignition with a soldering iron from one end.  Thermochemical equations governing the process were numerically solved by developing a finite element code.  Parameters like front speed, acceleration and temperature profile were computed.  The application of this phenomenon is in rapid manufacturing of composites.  The code was developed in MATLAB.
